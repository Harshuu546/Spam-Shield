# Spam-Shield
Spam Shield is a robust, machine learning-based project designed to identify and classify spam emails. It aims to enhance the email user experience by effectively filtering out spam messages while minimizing false positives and false negatives. This tool provides a scalable, accurate, and adaptive solution to combat evolving spam tactics.

## Features
- Efficient email classification into spam and non-spam (ham) categories.
- Preprocessing of email data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction.
- Machine learning algorithms trained on real-world datasets for high accuracy.
- Adaptability to new and evolving spam patterns.
- Performance evaluation using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Objectives
1. Build a reliable spam detection system with minimal misclassification rates.
2. Optimize the model for handling large email traffic in real-time.
3. Continuously improve adaptability to emerging spam techniques.
4. Provide seamless integration with existing email systems.
